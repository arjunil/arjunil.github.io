# About me

I'm currently playing the role of a Software Developer at AWS (Amazon Web Services, for the uninitiated)
In the past I have played the many roles that are a part of being a graduate student of Computer Science and Engineering at the State Universty of New York at Buffalo, a systems engineer at Infosys.

I occasionally tinker with the guitar, and take long walks into the wilderness (Pandemics and wildfires allowing). I have been intending to get into climbing and will eventually get around to it once I make it past the usual amounts of procrastination that come with existence.

I am currently engaged in the fast.ai course for deep learning which is turning out equal parts entertaining and educational

# Software Experience

I've dabbled a fair bit in the networking side of things. The more i dabble, the less i find I know.
Having worked at Infosys for almost three years and at Amazon for two, I can dafely say that that I am acutely aware of how little I truly know about anything. Fortunately, I'm quite adept at at my futile attempts at changing that, which makes for a great Sisyphean struggle. Much like life; but i digress.

# Education
Master's in Computer Science from the State University of New York at Buffalo (Yes, that cold place which for the most part I didn't mind much, despite my tropical origins)
Bachelor's in Electronics and Communcation Engineering from West Bengal University of Technology (Heritage Institure of Technology)

And a shout out to all the wonderful people I've met along the way in life thus far, who have intentionally or unintentionally) influenced my path in life and inadvertently imparted me an education I occasionally remember to be grateful for. Hopefully you know who you are, if not, watch out. I will ifnd you and let you know.

# Projects
I made a simplified DynamoDB replica in grad school that I was fairly proud of, because it did cool things involving CHORD and DHTs. Ask me about it sometime.
I also had the fortune of being advised during my Master's by Kenny (a.k.a Kenneth Joseph at UB) , who played a pivotal role in piquing my interest in computational social sciences and as a consequence(of immense efforts and guidance that we will skim over in the interest of time and patience, but no lack of gratitude) , I now am an officially published researcher : https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3479502 or if you prefer https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14120
